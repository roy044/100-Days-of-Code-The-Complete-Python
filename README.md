On 1st June 2021 I decided to undertake the 100 Days of Code Challenge , I browsed on the internet and came upon this course by Dr. Angela Yu - " 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 " 

P.S. Since I have prior knowledge in Python , I can easily complete 3-4 Day's Work in a Single Day owing to the fact its Beginner oriented.

I hope to Complete the Challenge by 9th September 2021 [100 days]
